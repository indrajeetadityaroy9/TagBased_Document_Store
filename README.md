# Hierarchical File Tagging and Organization Tool
A tool designed to organize and manage files within a structured, tag-driven hierarchy. It is particularly well-suited for use cases such as a document store that relies on folders to organize data efficiently.The tool dynamically extracts tags from file names, generates storage directories for each tag, and places files into the corresponding folders. 

For example, a file named CampusAtNight.jpg#Northeastern#EECE is automatically stored in the folders Northeastern and EECE, allowing for streamlined organization and retrieval. 

Key features include file tagging, dynamic directory creation, and database maintenance, all executed through modular functions for setup, tagging, and cleanup. With robust logging and error handling, this tool simplifies file management tasks, making it an ideal solution for organizing tagged data into a hierarchical file structure.
